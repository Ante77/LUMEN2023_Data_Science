This repository contains our submission for the LUMEN Data Science 2023 competition. The goal of the competition was to tackle the music instrument recognition from audio files problem. The project and technical documentations of the submission are located in the index folder, along with the file "Ocjene i komentari - Vi≈°e od LUMEN-a", which contains the final grades of the judging committee. The web application where one can test our models is also submitted inside the solution. The final models are not uploaded due to their size.
